## 📝 How to Edit `OpenLinks.json`

All your profile information, links, and theme settings are managed in the `OpenLinks.json` file at the root of the project. Here’s how to customize it:

### Example Structure

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "description": "Short bio or description.",
  "avatar": "/avatar.png",
  "theme": "ocean",
  "links": [
    {
      "title": "GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/yourusername",
      "icon": "/icons/github.svg"
    },
    {
      "title": "Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
      "icon": "/icons/twitter.svg"
    }
  ],
  "adultContent": false
}
```

### Fields

- **name:** Your display name.
- **description:** A short description or tagline.
- **avatar:** Path to your profile image (place it in the `public/` folder).
- **theme:** Choose a theme from those available in `themes.ts`.
- **links:** An array of your links. Each link can have:
  - `title`: The label shown on your page.
  - `url`: The destination URL.
  - `icon`: Path to an SVG icon (place SVGs in `public/icons/`).
- **adultContent:** Set to `true` to show a +18 warning banner.

### Customizing

- Add, remove, or edit links as needed.
- Change the theme by updating the `"theme"` value.
- Update your avatar or bio at any time.

After saving changes to `OpenLinks.json`, your site will update automatically in development mode.
